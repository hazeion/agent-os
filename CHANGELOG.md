# Changelog

All notable changes to Mentat.

## 2026-06-29

### Added
- Added local agent-message compose and status plumbing (`data/agent_messages.json`, `/api/agent-messages`) with queue-safe state transitions.
- Added project-scoped write APIs for creating/updating projects and richer task/project writeback from the frontend.
- Added read-only email surface (`data/email.json`, `/api/email`) and Obsidian notes cache keying by vault file metadata.
- Added a browser smoke script (`scripts/browser_smoke.mjs`) covering Today, Agents/Sessions, Calendar, Projects/Tasks, Notes, and Agent Message compose flows.

### Changed
- Introduced a shared, locked JSON file store (`json_store.py`) and updated server write paths to use allowlisted JSON updates for safer persistence.
- Updated setup/runtime workflow to better resolve Hermes home, local vault paths, and generated runtime state.
- Expanded visual/test contract handling around refined A desktop/task inspector and project/task editor behavior.
- Kept Dashboard write contracts project-owned while preserving Hermes core read-only boundaries.

### Fixed
- Updated tests and frontend contracts so dashboard contracts remain explicit and stable for the static-vanilla architecture.
- Ensured attention/task/project/agent payload flows align with new status and persistence handling.
